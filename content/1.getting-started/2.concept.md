Laravel Access Control helps you secure your application in the same place. Secure queries and endpoints using the same logic !

Here is a simple diagram of the concept:

First, we need to define perimeters:

## Perimeters

Perimeters permit defining the possible authorization scopes of your applications in a hierarchical way.

Let's take an example together, your projects define multiple scopes of authorizations for your task list application. An administrator can access all tasks,
a developer can only manage his client's tickets and all other users can only access their own tasks.

And there you have it, you have your perimeters:

items:
  - label: 'GlobalPerimeter'
    content: 'This defines a perimeter that allows access to all your application'
  - label: 'ClientPerimeter'
    content: 'This defines a perimeter that allows access to the user''s client related data'
  - label: 'OwnPerimeter'
    content: 'This defines a perimeter that allows access to the user''s own data'

## Controls

Now that we have our perimeters, we need to define them for each model in our application by defining a `Control` class for each.

Defined controls concern perimeters and configure them for the specific model. Let’s take a look at our `TaskControl` class:

```php
class TaskControl extends Control
{
    protected function perimeters(): array
    {
        return [];
    }
}
```

Our Control class is pretty simple, but as you can see, we now need to define our perimeters. Let’s look at the Global Perimeter definition:

```php
class TaskControl extends Control
{
    protected function perimeters(): array
    {
        return [
            GlobalPerimeter::new()
                ->allowed(function (Model $user, string $method) {
                    return $user->can(sprintf('%s global models', $method));
                })
                ->should(function (Model $user, Model $model) {
                    return true;
                })
                ->query(function (Builder $query, Model $user) {
                    return $query;
                }),
        ];
    }
}
```

Let's understand step by step, the `allowed` method configure the perimeter access for the current model, here we are checking if 
the user can pass the defined gate depending on the `method` invoked. This will give `view global models` for example when invoking the `view` 
method of the policy.
If a perimeter is allowed, it will then apply using `should` in a Policy context and `query` in an Eloquent Builder context. Also, it won't 
trigger any other perimeter if allowed, you can change that by using an [OverlayPerimeter](/essentials/perimeters#overlay-perimeter)

Now we'll see the ClientPerimeter:

```php
class TaskControl extends Control
{
    protected function perimeters(): array
    {
        return [
            GlobalPerimeter::new()
                ->allowed(function (Model $user, string $method) {
                    return $user->can(sprintf('%s global models', $method));
                })
                ->should(function (Model $user, Model $model) {
                    return true;
                })
                ->query(function (Builder $query, Model $user) {
                    return $query;
                }),
            ClientPerimeter::new()
                ->allowed(function (Model $user, string $method) {
                    return $user->can(sprintf('%s client models', $method));
                })
                ->should(function (Model $user, Model $model) {
                    return $model->client()->is($user->client);
                })
                ->query(function (Builder $query, Model $user) {
                    return $query->where('client_id', $user->client->getKey());
                }),
        ];
    }
}
```

We use the same logic for the `allowed` method by using a gate on the specified user.  
The `should` method now verifies if the specified task is linked by the same client as the user.
The `query` method now applies a limitation on the query by specifying the client_id requested for the tasks.

And you have it! If the global perimeter doesn’t apply, it then switches to the client perimeter, and so on.

## Policies

Now define your task policy to connect to access control:

```php
use Lomkit\Access\Policies\ControlledPolicy;
use App\Models\Task;

class TaskPolicy extends ControlledPolicy
{
    protected string $model = Task::class;
}
```

Your policy is ready to be used

```php
$user->can('view', App\Models\Task::first())
```

## Queries

Apply your control to your query:
```php
App\Models\Task::controlled()->get()
```
