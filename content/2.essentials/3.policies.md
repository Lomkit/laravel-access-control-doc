## Policies

In order to be applied to the policy, you need to extend the `ControlledPolicy` class and specify the linked control:

```php
use Lomkit\Access\Policies\ControlledPolicy;
use App\Access\Control\PostControl;

class PostPolicy extends ControlledPolicy
{
    protected string $control = PostControl::class;
}
```

And you are ready to go, have a look at the [usage section](/essentials/usage#policies) to apply the security wherever you want !
