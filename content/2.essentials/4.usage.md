## Query

Apply the `controlled` scope on needed queries.

```php
Post::controlled()
    ->get();
```

### Interactions with should
When using the query, Access Control will always use the `view` method in the `should` function. This is because it considers you are trying to view models 
since you make a SQL query.  
  
If you are on an index of a controller, the control might trigger twice, once for `viewAny` (Policy) and once for `view` (Query)


## Policies

Policies are secured by default for the common method: `viewAny`, `view`, `update`, `create`, `delete`, `restore`, `forceDelete`.

```php
$user->can('view', $post) // Will call the policy and Access Control
```
