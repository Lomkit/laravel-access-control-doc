::tip
You first need to install and configure [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/scout) on your project
::

## Scout Query

You have a `scoutQuery` method you can call directly on your defined perimeters in your control class.
This works the same as the query but you instead receive a `Scout Builder` instance.

```php
use Laravel\Scout\Builder;

class TaskControl extends Control
{
    protected function perimeters(): array
    {
        return [
            GlobalPerimeter::new()
                ->allowed(function (Model $user, string $method) {
                    // ...
                })
                ->scoutQuery(function (Builder $query, Model $user) {
                    return $query;
                })
        ];
    }
}
```

## Usage

You need to call the `controlled` method on your Scout Builder:

```php
App\Models\Post::search('Laravel Access Control')->controlled()->get();
```
